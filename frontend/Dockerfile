# It's probable best for using full distro image for development. Seems like some tools are missing
# from alpine images we do need in development.
# This would also mean it's best to split up the Dockerfile,
# into Dockerfile and Dockerfile.dev

# Stop at a specific build stageðŸ”—
# When you build your image, you donâ€™t necessarily need to build the entire Dockerfile
# including every stage. You can specify a target build stage.
# The following command assumes you are using the previous Dockerfile but
# stops at the stage.
#
# development-stage is also build when targetting production-stage.
# I think order here matters !
